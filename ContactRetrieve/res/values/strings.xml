    <string name="text_howto">Have you forgotten your mobile and need some contact of which only you have the number? No problem…\nThis application retrieves contact numbers that you want with a single text message (SMS)!\n\n
		It Works like this:\n
		Use someone else\'s phone to send a text message (SMS) to your phone in the following format:\n
		<b>#1 <i>name</i></b>\nwhere instead of <i>name</i> type the contact name that you want to retrieve.\nExamples:\n
		<b>#1 tiago</b>\n
		<b>#1 amy</b>\nWith that, your cell phone will automatically return a text message (SMS) to the device from which you sent, with the contacts and their numbers that you\'ve requested.\n\nThis application doesn\'t do any distinction between uppercase and lowercase, which means that
		<b>#1 tiago</b> is the same as <b>#1 TIAGO</b>\n\nIt\'s also possible to search contacts with parts of the name.\nExample:\n
		<b>#1 iago</b>\nIn this case, the application will return all contacts that contains iago as the name part (Tiago Emerick, Iago Zerber, Hiago, etc…)\n\nTo search for contacts, the name you\'re going to send should have at least 3 characters.
    </string>
    <string name="text_passwords">For your best security, this application make uses of passwords to search the contacts, but it doesn\'t mean that they are required.\nIf you just install the application and don\'t do anything else, it\'ll works without passwords witch means that anyone can send a text messagem to your device and request many contatcs as he wants.\nBut if you create passwords, the application will only work if you send the password in the text message.\n\n
		How it works:\nCreate many passwords as you want on menu <i>Preferences</i>.\nWhen you are using someones phone to search any contact, send a text message (SMS) to your device in the following format:\n
		<b>#1 <i>name</i>!<i>password</i></b>\nwhere instead of <i>name</i> type the contact name that you want to retrieve and instead of <i>password</i> type one of the passwords that you have registered.\nExamples:\n
		<b>#1 tiago!xpto</b>\nWith that your cell phone will automatically return a text message (SMS) to the device from whitch you sent, with the contacts and their numbers that you\'ve requested and will automatically <b>disable</b> the used password.\nIf you want to search others contatcs, you will have to send a new text message to your device using another password. If all your passwords end up, the application will work without them.\n
		If all your passwords end up, just send a text message to your device in the original format:\n
		<b>#1 <i>name</i></b> being no longer necessary to use signal ! to separate the password.\n\nCase you\'ve forgotten all passwords, you can see them using your <i>master password</i>. To do that send a text message to your device in the following format:\n
		<b>#1 $<i>masterPassword</i></b>\nwhere instead of <i>masterPassword</i> type your master password previously registered.\nWith that your cell phone will automatically return a text message (SMS) to the device from whitch you sent, with all registered passwords. Now just choose one of them to search for contacts.
   	</string>
    <string name="text_master_password">What\'s master password?\n\nThe master password is used to access the <i>Preferences</i> menu. There you can register security passwords. The security passwords is for ensure the application only works if you type one of them on original text message.\nTo learn more about security passwords, access <i>Help</i> menu and <i>Passwords</i> option.\n\n
		Master passwords is also used, if you forget all your security passwords, to retrieve all.\nTo do this, send a text message to your device in the followin format:\n
		<b>#1 $<i>masterPassword</i></b>\nwhere instead of <i>masterPassword</i> type your master password previously registered.\nWith that your cell phone will automatically return a text message (SMS) to the device from whitch you sent, with all registered passwords. Now just choose one of them to search for contacts.
    </string>
    <string name="text_symbols">Fast shortcuts to the used symbols in application:\n\n
		<b>#1</b> - Identifier used by application to determine if the SMS that is being received is to search for contacts.\nExample:\n
		<b>#1 <i>name</i></b>\n\n
		<b>!</b>  - Identifier used to separate the contact name of security password.\nExample:\n
		<b>#1 <i>name</i>!<i>password</i></b>\n\n
		<b>$</b>  - Identifier used to retrieve all security passwords using master password.\nExample:\n
		<b>#1 $<i>masterPassword</i></b>
    </string>
    <string name="text_costs">The application additional costs are based on a simple text message.\n\n
		When you use someone else\'s phone to send a text message to your device and search for a contact, you will spending the amount of a single common text message (SMS) from person that has lend you his device
		and a single or more (depending on text message length response) common text message (SMS) that will be sent automatically from your device with contact searched.\n\n
		If you want to access <b>Recover Master Password</b> menu, make sure that you have a established internet connection. This menu option will send an email to the previously registered email with a master password in attachment.\nIn this case pay attention to additional cost of 3G∕4G connection.
