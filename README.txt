contactretriever
================

Android application that retrieves a contact from your phone just using a single SMS.

It Works like this:
Use someone else's phone to send a text message (SMS) to your phone in the following format:
#1 name
where instead of name type the contact name that you want to retrieve.
Example:
#1 tiago

With that, your cell phone will automatically return a text message (SMS) to the device from which you sent, with the contacts and their numbers that you've requested.
